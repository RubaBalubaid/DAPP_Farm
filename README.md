In the Data Analyst Bootcamp, I completed a project aimed at improving the performance of a small organic farm. <br>The farm specializes in producing and selling its products directly to customers through local markets, organic stores, and online platforms. <br>The goal of the project was to analyze sales data to enhance operations and increase revenue.

## Project Description

**Data Used:**
- **Daily Sales Data:** A CSV file containing information on daily sales of the farm.
- **Customer Reviews:** A TSV file with customer feedback and reviews of the products.

**Tasks Accomplished:**

1. **Database Creation:**
   - Created a database using SQL, which included two main tables:
     - **Employee Table:** Containing information about the farm's employees.
     - **Animal Table:** Including data on the animals at the farm.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - **Customer Review Analysis:** Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze text and classify reviews into positive and negative categories using machine learning models. This analysis helped in understanding customer sentiments and identifying areas for improvement.

3. **Interactive Dashboard Creation:**
   - Linked various data sources in Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into sales data, customer reviews, and marketing analysis from different perspectives. It includes elements such as:
     - **Product Sales:** Displaying daily and weekly sales performance.
     - **Review Analysis:** Showing the distribution of positive and negative reviews.
     - **Marketing Analysis:** Offering insights into effective marketing strategies.

4. **Report Preparation:**
   - Prepared a comprehensive report detailing the analysis results and insights, including the database design and how it can be used to enhance farm operations.

**Technologies and Tools Used:**
- **SQL:** For creating and managing the database.
- **Power BI:** For creating the interactive dashboard.
- **NLP and Machine Learning:** For analyzing and classifying review texts.
